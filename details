LetsGetMarried.nyc

Wedding Officiant services
Legally submitted via existing official paper license 
Registered on the blockchain… 

Two participants (Spouse 1 and Spouse 2)
One or more witnesses
Need existing digital IDs (link out to create one if needed)

All 3+ Digital IDs agree that the ceremony has taken place, all sign the contract, officiant submits it, it’s considered executed, ethereum paid, confirmed on blockchain. The contract has no end date assumed. 

(Kind of like FAFSA submissions? User 1 logs in and signs, User 2 logs in and signs, User 3 logs in and signs, then I submit it as the officiant?)

Note: currently, only two-partner relationships are recognized by NYC, but let’s build this so it can support multiple partner relationships in the future (e.g. don’t limit to two on the back end, we’ll do that on the front end only for now).

What are we registering? 

Text:
Spouse 1 Digital ID public key
Spouse 2 Digital ID public key
Witness Digital ID public key (note: may be multiple)
Wedding Date
Wedding Location
City Office with which it’s registered (e.g., NY City Clerk)

Questions:
How exactly is it registered? Where? 
Should we assume uPort and Ethereum? 
Do they need a wallet, or can they pay us US$ and we initiate Ethereum contract?

I don’t see a need to use wedding.io or mywish or other platforms but let me know if you do

Not in scope: family contracts, vows, definition of marriage, finance, budgeting, etc. This is simpler: it’s just about identity and creating an alternative means to publicly record a legal marriage.

Maybe in scope, later: divorce (spousal Digital ID public keys used to end the contract); widowing (not sure what happens to Digital IDs on death, maybe a single ID can be used to initiate this? Will need more thought on this.)
